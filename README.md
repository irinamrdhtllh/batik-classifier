# batik-classifier

This repository contains a project revisiting one of my undergraduate projects from the Engineering Data Science course. The goal is to enhance the performance of a batik image classifier using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
- The current CNN-based classifier achieves an accuracy of approximately 85%.
- A ResNet18 transfer learning model serves as a comparator, achieving an accuracy of 90%.

### Dataset
The dataset include four batik patterns:
- Kawung
- Mega mendung
- Parang
- Truntum
